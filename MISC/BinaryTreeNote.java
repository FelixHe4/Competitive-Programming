	// A single node is a tree and this node is the root of a tree
	// no cycles, no loops.
	// each node has 0 or more child nodes
	// a node that has a child then it is called a parent node
	// root node has no parent, leaf node has no children
	// there is only 1 path between 1 vertex and another
	// depth is the length of the unique path from root to n
	// height is the longest path from ni to a leaf
	// full binary tree is has 2 children per node except for the leaf nodes (2 ^ n - 1) nodes
	// A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly
	// the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
	// tree height is n+1
